# [TalkPython Training](https://training.talkpython.fm/) page.
I am participating in an online Python training program, and this is where I host the coursework from our weekly sessions. I am using Jupyter Notebooks as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE) because I like the flexibility that the notebooks offer. I was looking for a way to share my notebooks more broadly, and stumbled on an open source project named [Binder](https://mybinder.org) that allows anyone with the link to execute a notebook online. It's pretty neat; give it a try. You can make all the changes you want in the notebook, and you can rerun the cells to your heart's content, but the original notebook remains unchanged (so, go for it!). 

If you click on the links below you will be redirected to the Binder site. Binder will pull down a copy of the .ipynb file (_that's an interactive python notebook file that is somewhat similar to a Python script (\*.py) you might have on your local computer_), load it up in a docker instance, and present it back to you so that you can select the specific page you want to see and edit away. It takes a little time to get going on your first pass because it's pulling down the entire folder, but as long as you're seeing motion on the Binder page, you'll be fine.

Once you're in the notebook, you'll find the following pages: 

|Week|Chapter|Notebook Name|
|----|-------|-------------|
|One|4|cohort_chapter_four.ipynb|

Enjoy!
