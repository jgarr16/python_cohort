# TalkPython Training page.
I am participating in an online Python training program by [TalkPython Training](https://training.talkpython.fm/), and this is where I host the coursework from our weekly sessions. I decided to use Jupyter Notebooks as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE) because I like the flexibility that they offer, but I wanted to share them more broadly. That's when I stumbled on an open source project named [Binder](https://mybinder.org). Binder allows anyone with the link to execute a notebook online, just as if they were using the application on their local computer. Once they're opened, you can make all the changes you want in the notebook, and you can rerun the cells to your heart's content, but the original source file remains unchanged (__so, don't hold back; make those changes!__). 

If you click on the link below, you will be redirected to the Binder site. Then Binder will pull down a copy of the .ipynb file (_an interactive python notebook file that is somewhat similar to a Python script (\*.py) that you might have on your local computer_) from my GitHub account, load it up in a docker instance, and present it back to you so that you can select the page you want to see and start editing. 

It takes a few seconds to get going on your first pass, but as long as you're seeing motion on the Binder page, you'll be fine. 

### [Access the Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jgarr16/python_cohort/79d99ba934f7650df8ea1248c4edd5e71941f6a2)

Once you're in the notebook, you'll find the following pages: 

|Week|Chapter|Notebook Name|
|----|-------|-------------|
|One|4|cohort_chapter_four.ipynb|

It's pretty neat; I hope you'll give it a try. Enjoy!
